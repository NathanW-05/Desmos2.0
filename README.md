# As this is public
This project was never finished due to boredom. Released because Node3112 publicized his. The exploit behind this used to work on constantiam and 2b2t pre and post nocom. This program was one of many, and the exploit behind it was found before nocom was public and is in no way associated with nerds inc. This project and exploit work similarly to nocom but is fully independent of it.
